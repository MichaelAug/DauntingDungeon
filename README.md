# Daunting Dungeon - a truly daunting experience


#### Daunting Dungeon is a 2D sprite-based video game made using SDL2. It is available on Windows and Linux(X11, Wayland)

The goal of the game is to stay alive and kill as many enemies as possible. As the game goes on health items spawn less often, enemies spawn more frequently and become more aggressive.
